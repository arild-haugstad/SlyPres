SlyPress
=======
SlyPress is an open source slide presentation framework supporting, amongst other things, animations and mathtex formulae.

==========
This code is in a somewhat preliminary alpha state. It is currently being cleaned up and fixed, and there will be no significant new features implemented while this is going on.
Also, things will change, sooner or later. I make no promises about backward compatibility at this point in time.

There are currently some issues with getting SlyPress to run reliably on different machines. These stem usually from setup difficulties with ChromeDriver. Just don't expect this code to run out-of-the box in its current state.

A number of obvious things are still a little broken or quirky. I will get these listed in the issue tracker as soon as possible, and start working on them as a part of the cleanup.

In short: If you're adventurous, you're welcome to try out the code as it stands. But it is somewhat buggy and will be missing a lot of obvious features that would be really nice to have. Such features are likely coming up in the future, *after* the cleanup!

All that being said, I have used SlyPress seriously in both a programming course and a for a few shorter presentations. If you can get used to the quirks it has currently, and work around its shortcomings, you may find some of the ideas behind it intriguing, and maybe even find the software itself somewhat useful.

Enjoy!
